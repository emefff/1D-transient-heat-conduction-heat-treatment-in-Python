# 1D-transient-heat-conduction-heat-treatment-in-Python

**This work is based on https://github.com/alexlib/trans_heat_cond/blob/master/LICENSE, thanks a lot. 
The attached code is still wortk in progress, it shows some weird behaviour under certain conditions.
To-Dos: functionalizing, cleaning up, find reason for weird oscillations etc.
Use at your own risk, any help is greatly appreciated! Thank you!**

The 1D transient heat equation is solved for conduction and heat transfer to the surface of a steel slab. This is useful for heat treatment, especially for estimating the soaking time
